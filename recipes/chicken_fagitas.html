        <ol>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk lime juice, red pepper, 1/4 cup oil, and 1 teaspoon cumin. 
                Season chicken with salt and black pepper, then add to bowl and toss to coat. Cover 
                and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add chicken and 
                cook until golden brown and cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted 
                into thickest part registers 160Â°, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board.
                 Let rest 10 minutes, then slice into strips.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Meanwhile, in same skillet over medium heat, combine peppers, onion, and remaining 1 
                teaspoon cumin; season with salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until 
                softened, about 7 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and toss until combined.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
